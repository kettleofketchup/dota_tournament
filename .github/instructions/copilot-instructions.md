to run python, you have to source .venv/bin/activate

## Django Management Commands

### Redis/Caching Dependencies
Some Django management commands may fail if Redis is not available, especially when using django-cacheops or Redis-backed caching. If you encounter Redis connection errors during database operations (like `populate_users`), you can disable caching:

```bash
DISABLE_CACHE=true python manage.py <command>
```

This environment variable:
- Sets Django's CACHES to use DummyCache (no-op cache)
- Disables CACHEOPS entirely (empty configuration)
- Allows management commands to run without Redis dependency

Common scenarios where this is needed:
- Database population scripts
- Data migration commands
- Development setup without Docker/Redis
- CI/CD environments without Redis service

# Project coding standards


## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS modules for component styling

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Frontend Logging Guidelines

- Use the `getLogger` function to create a logger instance for each module named log
    - Example: `import {getLogger} from '~/index'; const log = getLogger('<moduleName>');`
- Frontend: Log messages should include the module name for context
- Frontend: Use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Frontend:  Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens)
- Frontend: Use structured logging where possible (e.g., JSON format)
- Frontend: Use `log.debug` for detailed debugging information
- Frontend: Use `log.info` for general information messages
- Frontend: Use `log.warn` for warnings that do not require immediate attention
- Frontend: Use `log.error` for error messages that require attention




# Steam API


Python: SteamAPI callers in python to parse steamapi for dota games. This will be stored in a Django cache to ensure rate limiting and the typescript will only ever call the Django endpoints

typescript: some library with that has the steamapi types to parse steamapi json from the backend.

Other use cases involving steam api include:
- searching for a steamid from a username
- searching for games involving a users in the dtx dota guild
- searching for live stats of active dota games involving people

Type script/frontend side only get steamapi data from the python. Only python does the calling.

With this information what libraries handle a lot of this info. Please provide with last update and last 6 month commit history for the project


## Documentation

This project uses Poetry for Python dependency management. All Python modules and dependencies should be added using Poetry commands. The `pyproject.toml` file is stored in the root of the project.

### Adding Dependencies

To add new Python modules to the project: use poetry add <module_name>
